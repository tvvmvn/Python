# Iterator vs Iterable

# Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets are all iterable objects. 
# They are iterable containers which you can get an iterator from.

# All these objects have a iter() method which is used to get an iterator:


# Return an iterator from a tuple, and print each value:
mytuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
myit = iter(mytuple)

print(next(myit))
print(next(myit))
print(next(myit))
