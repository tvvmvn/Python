# You can also customize your own function by using the keyword argument key = function.

# The function will return a number that will be used to sort the list (the lowest number first):


# Sort the list based on how close the number is to 50:

def myfunc(n):
  return abs(n - 50)

thislist = [100, 50, 65, 82, 23]
thislist.sort(key = myfunc)

print(thislist)
