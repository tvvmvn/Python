# Once a tuple is created, you cannot change its values. 
# Tuples are unchangeable, or immutable as it also is called.

# But there is a workaround. You can convert the tuple into a list, 
# change the list, and convert the list back into a tuple.


# Convert the tuple into a list to be able to change it:
x = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")

y = list(x)

y[1] = "kiwi"

x = tuple(y)

print(x)
