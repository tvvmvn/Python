# 2. Add tuple to a tuple. 

# You are allowed to add tuples to tuples, so if you want to add one item, (or many), 
# create a new tuple with the item(s), and add it to the existing tuple:


# Create a new tuple with the value "orange", and add that tuple:
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")

y = ("orange",)

thistuple += y

print(thistuple)
