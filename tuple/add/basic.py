# Since tuples are immutable, they do not have a built-in append() method, 
# but there are other ways to add items to a tuple.

# 1. Convert into a list: Just like the workaround for changing a tuple, 
# you can convert it into a list, add your item(s), and convert it back into a tuple.


# Convert the tuple into a list, add "orange", and convert it back into a tuple:

thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")

y = list(thistuple)

y.append("orange")

thistuple = tuple(y)
