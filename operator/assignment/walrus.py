# Python 3.8 introduced the := operator, known as the "walrus operator". 
# It assigns values to variables as part of a larger expression:

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
count = len(numbers)

if count > 3:
    print(f"List has {count} elements")

if (count := len(numbers)) > 3:
    print(f"List has {count} elements")
