# The difference() method will return a new set that will contain only the items from the first set that are not present in the other set.


# Keep all items from set1 that are not in set2:

set1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
set2 = {"google", "microsoft", "apple"}

set3 = set1.difference(set2)

print(set3)


# You can use the - operator instead of the difference() method, and you will get the same result.


# Use - to join two sets:
set1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
set2 = {"google", "microsoft", "apple"}

set3 = set1 - set2
print(set3)
