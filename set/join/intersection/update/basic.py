# The intersection_update() method will also keep ONLY the duplicates, 
# but it will change the original set instead of returning a new set.


# Keep the items that exist in both set1, and set2:

set1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
set2 = {"google", "microsoft", "apple"}

set1.intersection_update(set2)

print(set1)
