# The union() method returns a new set with all items from both sets.


# Join set1 and set2 into a new set:
set1 = {"a", "b", "c"}
set2 = {1, 2, 3}

set3 = set1.union(set2)
print(set3)


# You can use the | operator instead of the union() method, and you will get the same result.


# Use | to join two sets:
set1 = {"a", "b", "c"}
set2 = {1, 2, 3}

set3 = set1 | set2
print(set3)
